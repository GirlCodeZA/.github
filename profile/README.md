# Hello ðŸ‘‹

GirlCode is a registered NPO (158-642) aimed at empowering young women and girls through technology. GirlCode was founded in 2014 as a women only hackathon to address the inequality and gender gap in the tech space. GirlCode has evolved into an Educational institution that engages women in tech, facilitates their skills advancement and entry into the tech industry.

We are on a mission to empower 10 million women and girls by 2030 by creating a network of women who are highly skilled in software development and leadership skills who will contribute towards an inclusive and innovative technology industry.

## Our Initiatives

We plan to reach our mission through various initiatives such as:

- Hackathons

GirlCodeHack is an annual event where computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects. The primary goal of this event is to raise awareness of female technical talent and foster a competitive, yet cooperative, and congenial culture for talented female techies.

- GirlCoder Club

The girls in the program will have a choice of learning basic computer literacy skills that will help them in university no matter what career they choose or they could learn everything from mobile development to HTML and CSS while gaining exposure to the tech industry and receiving valuable mentorship from women working in technology.

- Learnerships
